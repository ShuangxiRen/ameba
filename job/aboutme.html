<p style="font-weight:bold">Dear Sir/Madam:</p>
<p>
I just graduated from Pennsylvania State University (PSU), with a master degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
I am now living in Bluffton with my wife who is a faculty in University of South Carolina Beaufort. I am looking for a
job as a web developer near Bluffton.
<br><br>
I came into contact with web development in my database course and I found I so love it. Then I learned HTML, CSS, PHP 
and JavaScript. To demonstrate my knowledge of them, I developed this demo shopping website based on LAMP. Then
I purchased a domain name and server resource to show it to my potential employers. 
<br><br>
Since I want to make this demo
ready before I give out my first resume, I choose to use as short time as possible (less than three weeks) to simply 
realize the core functions, without paying much attention to the layout and beautification. However, I take into account
of preventing XSS attack and SQL injection by validating and sanitizing form data, and by using sql prepared statements.
<br><br>
In order to understand these languanges well, I design the whole project by myself and type down all the source code without
using any templates or models.
</p>
<p>Following are the main functions of this website and each works well under Chrome.</p>
<ul>
<li>create a user and sign in</li>
<li>update your personal information</li>
<li>upload your items for sale directly or for auction</li>
<li>search for items or browse items by categories</li>
<li>add items into your wishlist</li>
<li>purchase items</li>
<li>bid items</li>
<li>maintain the delivery process either as a seller or buyer</li>
<li>rate and review other users or get rated or reviewed by other users</li>
<li>check your order list</li>
<li>check your selling list</li>
<li>check reviews you get from other users</li>
<li>contact other users through messages</li>
<li>get system messages during a purchase or bid behavior</li>
</ul>
